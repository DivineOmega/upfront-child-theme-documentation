# Upfront Child Theme Documentation

This documentations attempts to explain how WPMU Upfront child themes (such as Spirit) are build up and how they function. This is currently derived from our own experience of using the Upfront editor and analysis of the code behind the child themes.

So far, we have:

* [File Structure](file-structure.md) - A description of the file structure and the main files/directories that are contained within a typical Upfront child theme.
