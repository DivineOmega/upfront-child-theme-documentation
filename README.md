# Upfront Child Theme Documentation

This documentation attempts to explain how [WPMU Upfront](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/introducing-upfront/) child themes (such as [Spirit](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/spirit/)) are built and how they function. This is currently derived from our own experience of using the Upfront editor and our analysis of the code behind the available child themes.

Hopefully this will aid those wishing to create their own Upfront child themes, or just those wishing to make customisations to existing child themes.

* [File Structure](file-structure.md) - A description of the file structure and the main files/directories that are contained within a typical Upfront child theme.
